# JWT Authentication With Vuejs and Nodejs

This is a project based on tutorial from Auth0 [Build an App with Vue.js: From Authentication to Calling an API]. I'm grateful for this example for begginer in how to learning more about node and authentication a feature used very much nowadays.

I recommend to make the tutorial step-by-step to learning and understanding more about [Vuejs] and [Node.js].

### Installation

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Npm]. I make all the tutorial on linux and I believe be the same in Windows and MacOS.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone
$ npm install
```
After install everything and with webpack-dev-server installed

```sh
$  webpack-dev-server --inline --hot
```

Open a new terminal in the root and into folder server start the server.

```sh
$ cd server
$ npm install
$ node server.js
```
Obs: I put the server into the project to be more easy to use for begginers like me.

Done! Go to http://localhost:8080/
